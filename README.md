# Yolo-MSAPF
This project is the source and code for the paper titled “Yolo-MSAPF: Multi-Scale Alignment fusion with Parallel feature Filtering model for high accuracy weld defect detection”. We will upload the source and code after the paper is publicly published.


The weld surface dataset is collected from a commercial company. Therefore, this dataset is limited to academic use！！！Prohibited for any commercial use！！！


If you need this dataset to do some research, please contact us. After review and permission by the commercial company, we will provide the dataset to you.

！！！！！！Due to the restriction of the confidentiality policy, the detailed information for the industrial detection platform cannot be displayed at present！！！！！！！

We set up a harsh detection environment in lab to test and demonstrate the application capabilities of the Yolo-MSFPA model. 

The hardware platform is show in the following picture.
